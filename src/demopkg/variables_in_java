Variables:	variables is an emplty container which holds value;

How to write variable:     int i = 10;   //here i is the variable name or identifier;
										//10 is the value
										// int is the data-type

Rules for identifier:
			1.identifier contains letters, numbers,dollar($),underscore(_)
			2.it can't start with numbers;
			3.keywords/reserved words are not allowed as an identifier
			4.Case sensitive i.e. ABC and abc are the individual identifier.  
										
Types of data in java:

1.Primitive data-types:
			1.Numeric : byte(1b), short(2b),int (4b),long(8bytes)
			2.Decimal : float(4b),double(8b)
			2.character: char (2b)
			3.boolean : true/false(size depends on jvm)
	
2.Non-primitive data-types :
			1.Array
			2.String
			3.Enum
			
Operators:
			are the symbols which performs operation on operands
			
			Types of Operators:

			1.Arithmetic :
							+,-,*,/,%
			2.urinary    :
							++ (pre/post)
							--(pre/post)
			3.Assignment :
							=
							compound assignment operator:
							
							+=,-=,/=,*=
			4.Comparison :
							==,>,<,>=,<=,!=
							
			5.Logical Operator:
			
							AND &&
							OR  ||
							not  !
							
							
							
Type Casting : changing one datatype to other;

			1.Implicit TypeCasting (Widening) done by java or JVM
				
				byte -> short -> int -> long ->float -> double
				
				char -> int
			2.Explicit TypeCasting (Narrowing) done by user:
			
				double -> float -> long -> int -> short -> byte
				int ->  char
